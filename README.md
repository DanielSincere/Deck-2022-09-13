# Pushing to the App Store with Swift - Presentation

See the talk on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxozYjWMhgU)!

Uses [DeckUI](https://github.com/joshdholtz/DeckUI) for slides!

## Setup

Install [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) and use [Swish](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Swish) as a task runner.

1. `brew install mint`
2. `mint bootstrap -l`
3. `swish project`

And then set your "Development Team" to run locally on your Mac.
